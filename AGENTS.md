<!-- window server: verifying UI changes on :8787 after a merge — static
     assets (app.js/style.css) refresh on browser reload, but server.mjs
     runs in the launchd daemon's memory: bounce it with
     `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/local.agentic-os.window`
     (details: autojobs show agentic-os-window) before concluding a
     server-side fix "didn't land". -->
